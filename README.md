# Encom-WebOS-NodeServer
Basically back-end JavaScript runtime environment for www.encom.rf.gd

- Custom command line interface (CLI) console app with Node.js 
- has ability of running CRUD functionality on users stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose. 
- Also uses commander.js for the CLI tools and inquirer.js for the user experience. (At the moment)

Work in progress.
